								<p>In a modern market of business executives and government officials who romanticize the term ‘fourth industrial revolution’, are there any significant benefits of this proposed revolution or is it a sham aimed at brainwashing the public to believe that innovation is occurring?</p>
                                <p>The fourth industrial revolution is something that is difficult to wrap your head around. Approaching this from a technical background where everything must be questioned and proven, these concepts that surround the 4IR and the realities that could be in the future are not very easy to conceptualise.  It is therefore, that I have studied this topic further and aim to provide clarity in a market that romanticises this term and uses it as a blanket statement for any innovation without knowing fundamentally how and why it can be of benefit.</p>

								<h3>What is 4IR?</h3>
                                <p><<a href="https://www.qualitymag.com/articles/95398-ndt-automation" class="image right"><img src="images/Intelligent-Automation.webp" alt="" /></a>The fourth industrial revolution (4IR), a term coined such by Klaus Schwab to symbolise the transformation of how humans interact with technology (Xu, David, & Kim, 2018). In its most basic description it is rapid innovation that aids in the life of humans and how we live.</p>
                                <p>The 4IR builds on the third industrial revolution that manifested the use of information technology and automation of production. 4IR modernises the materials used and processes of automation and technology to achieve new heights of technological advancements (Schwab, 2017) (World Economic Forum, n.d.).</p>
                                <h3>Potential benefits to society</h3>
                                <p>Technologies such as artificial intelligence and 3D printing are just two examples that drive the 4IR. It is not uncommon to have voice activated virtual assistants ‘remembering’ tasks for you or autonomous self-driving cars taking control while the driver can sip some coffee. These innovations are the cornerstone in implementing the technologies of the future.</p>
                                <p>The fourth industrial revolution is one that brings new innovations and ways of thinking previously unheard of in many industries. Medical procedures like eardrum and hip replacements can now be done through the use of 3D printed synthetic bone that was unheard of just 10 short years ago.</p>
                                <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oGoMtjuiwE8" class="button large">Link to Video</a></p>
                                <p>South Africa is a nation that can rise to the occasion. As the nation that introduced the world to heart transplants, CAT Scans, and the Ubuntu Operating System (SA Good News, n.d.) (Wikipedia, n.d.), South Africans have proven their competency by embracing new technology. As a matter of fact, the first 3D-printed bone transplant was performed by Professor Mashudu Tshifularo at the Steve Biko Academic Hospital putting south Africa as a forerunner for 4IR in the African continent (Duvenage, 2021) (Tabbey-Botchwey, n.d.).</p>
                                <p><<a href="https://lejournaldelafrique.com/en/intelligence-artificielle-et-depot-de-brevet-la-revolution-sud-africaine/?noamp=mobile" class="image left"><img src="images/Cover-DABUS.webp" alt="" /></a>These innovations occurred in a pre-coronavirus era, however that has not stopped South Africa from obtaining its very first AI patent, DABUS (Device for Autonomous Bootstrapping of Unified Sentience) during the midst of the pandemic. 4IR development has sped up due to the novel coronavirus pandemic and high importance has been placed on technologies like AI, IoT, blockchain, 3D printing and robotics (Agbehadji, Awuzie, & Ngowi, 2021). These technologies played crucial roles in enabling life during a pandemic to occur seamlessly and efficiently and have in a way sped up the arrival of 4IR in many parts of the world (Mhlanga, 2021).</p>
                                <h3>Challenges it can present in South Africa</h3>
                                <p><<a href="https://www.yomzansi.com/2022/03/07/eskom-stage-2-loadshedding-07-march/"class="image right"><img src="images/eskom.webp" alt="" /></a>Many countries in Africa are still playing catch-up to reap the rewards of the third industrial revolution and South Africa, whilst among the more affluent, is still plagued with some downfalls. Problems regarding perpetuating lack /shortages of electricity has become a staple country-wide, and South Africans are only now starting to explore alternative measures of power generation (Onwuegbuie & Ojo, 2021).</p>
                                <p>The literacy rate of many individuals in the country are low thus not enabling a comprehensive understanding of the technologies that 4IR brings. There needs to be more importance placed on scientific and technological literacy in the country before 4IR can be fully adopted and can drive innovation (Sokolow, 2020).</p>
                                <h3>Opportunities for South Africa in terms of 4IR and in particular the technologies underpinning 4IR I feel have the most promise for South Africa</h3>
                                <p>South Africa is a dynamic nation not afraid of change – allowing for evolution and adaptability. It already has two major accomplishments/contributions to the world in the 4IR – being Artificial Intelligence and 3D printed-based medical procedures. These are first class innovative technologies of the 4IR and that I feel should be the foundation we as a nation build upon to showcase our contribution.</p>
                                <p>It is most promising for the nation to keep its focus on these two leading technologies and thereby allowing South Africa to stay competitive and bring about more opportunities for growth and development in the 4IR.</p>
